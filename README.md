# Stack

My implementation of a linear list (Stack) sorting algorithm.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local
machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* **CMake v3.15+** - found at [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)
* **C++ Compiler** - needs to support at least the **C++17** standard, i.e. *MSVC*, *GCC*, *Clang*

### Installing

It is fairly easy to install the project, all you need to do is clone if from [GitHub](https://github.com/kramber1024/stack)

To get a copy of this project you simply need to run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kramber1024/stack.git
```

## Building the project

To build the project, all you need to do, ***after correctly
[installing the project](README.md#Installing)***, is run a similar **CMake** routine
to the the one below:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Usage

After building and running the program, you will get sorting benchmark results on 100 - 1000 stack sizes.

## Features

* **CMake configuration**
* **Doxygen documentation**
